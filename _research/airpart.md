Single-cell RNA-seq of F1 crosses enables measurement of context-specific allelic expression (AE), where the cell type or cell stage can be taken as the context that influences cis-genetic regulation. Spatially resolved or time course allelic datasets offer another such example. airpart provides discrete grouping of
cell types, providing interpretability to the fitted models. The groups
provided by the partition step can help to generate hypotheses of
CTS cis-regulatory mechanisms. For example, cell types within the
same group may share a common mechanism of cis-regulation, such
as a common set of expressed transcription factors and active regulatory elements harboring genetic variation. Additionally, airpart can be used to model continuous gradients of cis-regulatory
effects on cells or samples.

## Dynamic allelic imbalance in RNA-seq
------
<p style="text-align: justify">
airpart partitioning of the time series by allelic ratio revealed
four types of patterns (decreasing, increasing, up-peak and downpeak) as shown in Figure 3(Dâ€“G), respectively. As in the original study,
we also observed the dominant allele could switch over the time
course, or bi-allelically expressed genes could switch to dominant by
one or the other allele. While the original paper used logistic regression with polynomial terms for time within each individual, we
recovered similar DAI trends for many autoimmune genes, such as
GNLY and DDX11. Overall, airpart successfully captured the DAI
patterns seen across T-cell activation
