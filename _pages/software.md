* Modular package for generation of sets of ranges representing the
  null hypothesis. These can take the form of `bootRanges`, block
  bootstrap samples of ranges, or `matchRanges`, sets of control
  ranges that are matched across one or more covariates. 
  Developed by Wancen Mu, Eric Davis, and Douglas Phanstiel (UNC-CH). 
  Contributions from other Bioconductor developers as well.
  Funding provided by CZI EOSS award.

* Identification of differential cell-type-specific allelic imbalance
  across cell types or states, utilizing single-cell allelic counts.
  Provides partitioning of cell types by allelic signal using
  generalized fused lasso, plus many EDA and QC plotting functions.
  Developed by Wancen Mu, in collaboration with the Patro group
  (UMD) and KB Choi (JAX).
